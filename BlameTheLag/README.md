# Blame The Lag

A game about guiding a ball through simple obstacles, but the ball lags behind the cursor.

Visibility is just one of the mechanics that can be used to challenge a player.

The script was designed to be generic so that it could be used broadly and easily by
just attaching it to an object in Unity and selecting the options.

The accompanying editor script changes how the script is displayed in Unity's inspector
to make it more clear and organized.
